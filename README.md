## Three Principles

redux has 3 principles

1. **Single source of truth**

The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.

2. **State is read-only**

The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.

3. **Changes are made with pure functions**

To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.
